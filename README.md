# Video App

This is a simple video app execise to practice REACT.

Here I made a single page app where the user can login and watch some vids.

The videos are stored on a JSON that you can fetch through a back-end route.

- It shows a grid of the videos available. ✔️
- You pick the video you wanna see by clicking on it's thumbnail img. ✔️
- Your chosen video will render on screen. ✔️
- You can leave comments and see other peoples comments. ✔️
- You can give likes or dislikes (only on a superficial level, more deep functionality requires connection to a DB). ✔️
- You can also filter any video from the data base with the search bar. ✔️
