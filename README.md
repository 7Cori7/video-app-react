# Video App

This is a simple video app execise I made to practice REACT.

Here I created a single page app where the user can login and watch some vids.

The videos are stored in a JSON and you can fetch the data from API or from local route...

- It shows a grid of the videos available. ✔️
- You can pick the video you wanna see by clicking on its thumbnail img. ✔️
- Your chosen video will render on screen. ✔️
- You can leave comments and see other peoples comments (comments are saved in the localStorage for now). ✔️
- You can give likes or dislikes (only on a superficial level, more deep functionality requires connection to a DB). ✔️
- You can also filter any video from the data base with the search bar. ✔️

In the future I might try out some connections to a database and backend server, but for now it is what it is 😗

The demo is hosted on vercel and you can try it here --> https://video-app-silk.vercel.app/

Have a nice day~ 🐼
